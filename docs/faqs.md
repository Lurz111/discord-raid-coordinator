# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you setup a bot for my server?

Sorry, but no. Every public bot I've used has had periods of opaque downtime and I'm not prepared to support servicing the many existing PoGo discord servers. This repo should contain all the instructions necessary to set it up yourself.

### I want the bot to do X, can you make it do X?

Open up an issue on the github page and we can discuss it. There are many suggestions of features to add, but it is important to keep them universally applicable and useful to most PoGo discord groups. If its of use to most servers, we can talk about adding it to the bot.
