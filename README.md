## Notes on Future of this Project

This project end of life, but not yet dead. I am in the process of replacing this with a larger project in the same vien which will be hosted for other discords. I will link here when complete. This will most likely mean that this project will remain open source, and the newer one may or may not, as it will tie into a lot more infrastructure and dependencies and grow into something bigger.

The original vision for this bot was a small one that one could host without needing a database or any additional infrastructure. I am happy to take on other contributors and maintainers to keep this going.

If you want another self-hosted solution, MeowthBot came later and is an excellent choice used by many: https://github.com/FoglyOgly/Meowth.
